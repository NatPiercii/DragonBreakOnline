# CMake Workflow

## DragonBreak note (2026-07-28): building the C++ locally

The server manager's Build tab has a **Native (C++)** button that runs this whole
flow for you (`server-manager/src/build.js` -> `buildNative`), or `build native`
in the manager console. It uses the same flags as the flatrim CI workflow.

Toolchain state: VS 2022 Community 17.14 lives at
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community` with the C++ workload
(MSVC 14.44, Windows SDK 10.0.26100, CMake 3.31.6), installed on the new box on
2026-09-11. The old box kept it on `X:`, and CMake pins a build tree to the VS
install it was first configured with, so `build/` kept asking for `X:`. The
manager now passes CMake the install vswhere finds, and when `build/` points at
a different one it deletes `build/CMakeCache.txt` and `build/CMakeFiles` before
configuring (`build/dist` and `build/vcpkg_installed` stay). If the workload
ever needs reinstalling, run elevated:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe" modify --installPath "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community" --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended --passive --norestart
```

Do not add `--wait`; `vs_installer.exe` rejects it with exit code 87 (it is a
flag for the `vs_community.exe` bootstrapper, not the installer).

That brings MSVC v143, the Windows SDK and CMake. The first native build then
compiles every vcpkg dependency (expect 1-3 hours and tens of GB); later builds
are incremental. The `CI Rebuild` button remains the alternative.

**Two flags in the circulating "SkyMP Build Instructions" note are fictional:**
`-DSKYMP_VOICE_CHAT=ON` is read by nothing, and `-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=voice-chat`
**aborts** the configure (no such vcpkg feature). Do not pass either; voice chat is
already implemented in this fork (see docs/dragonbreak_voice_chat.md).

## Upstream documentation

Our build system is CMake-based. This document describes some caveats of our CMake code and guides you in making changes in CMake parts of the codebase.

When you switch between commits, you should run `cmake ..` in the `build` directory. This action is called "CMake re-generation".

On Windows the build requires the `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator (v143 toolset). CMake enforces this and errors out on older Visual Studio generators. CI runs on the `windows-2022` runner. A local configure looks like:

```
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DSKYRIM_DIR="<your Skyrim install folder>"
```

Note: there is no `SKYMP_VOICE_CHAT` CMake option or `voice-chat` vcpkg feature in this tree. Do not pass `-DSKYMP_VOICE_CHAT=ON` (nothing reads it) or `-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=voice-chat` (vcpkg aborts with an unknown-feature error). See `dragonbreak_voice_chat.md`.

## Adding Source Files

* **Visual Studio**: `Add -> New Item -> /a meaningful source directory, not the build directory/`. No need to re-generate project files.
* **VS Code**: Add file normally, then re-generate project files. CMake extension for VS Code normally re-generates each time you press Ctrl+S in root `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Modifying CMakeLists

* When the content of CMakeLists has changed, you need to re-generate CMake.

* Call `apply_default_settings` for all added targets:
  ```cmake
  apply_default_settings(TARGETS skyrim_platform)
  ```

* When you add a new C/C++ target, that requires dependencies from vcpkg, you do not need to link them manually `target_link_libraries`, but simply add such target to the `VCPKG_DEPENDENT` list:
  ```cmake
  list(APPEND VCPKG_DEPENDENT skyrim_platform)
  ```

* Usually project's CMakeLists.txt has something like this:
  ```cmake
  foreach(target ${VCPKG_DEPENDENT})
    # link everything
  endforeach()
  ```

## CMake Errors

When generating project files with CMake, errors are dumped into the console. If generation fails, then you see these lines in your terminal:
```
- Configuring incomplete, errors occured
```

It is necessary to look above and find `CMake Error at...`. There would be a path and a line number. By the way, VS Code is able to highlight this.

## Troubleshooting

```
 CMake Error at vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:857 (_find_package):
   Could not find a configuration file for package "directxtk" that is
   compatible with requested version "".
```
This error has been reported by VS Code user. Solution:
1. It seems that `amd64_x86` kit is selected. SkyMP doesn't support `x86` builds currently. Change the active kit to `amd64`.

2. Remove `build/CMakeCache.txt` and `build/CMakeFiles`
3. Re-generate project files.
